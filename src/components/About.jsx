          My name is Santiago, I'm 27 and I'm looking for my first job in IT.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous jobs I was Motion Grapher and Designer but while trying
          to find some course to specialize in I came across Javascript. From
          that moment I decided to give a new direction to my profession and
          began to learn web development and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, I took a 5 months bootcamp focused on fullstack
          development, where I learned React, Redux, NodeJS, SQL and agile
          methodologies like SCRUM and Jira.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I want to become a developer, combining my experience and
          programming, and in the future I would love to learn about AI and Data
          Science.
        </p>
